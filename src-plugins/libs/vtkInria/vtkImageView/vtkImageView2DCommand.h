/**
   Notes on Nicolas Toussaint changes


   A) Methods, API
   A command must have only the execute() method and a bunch of
   events to deal with. the rest should be dealt with in the interactorStyle

   B) The Zoom and Pan events as separated in Pierre's version are still work
   in progress to be separated here as well. Zoom is done but pan is still to be done.

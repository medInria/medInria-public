/**
   \class vtkLandmark vtkLandmarkManager.h "vtkLandmarkManager.h"
   \brief Concrete class representing a point in space, its representation, and some additional parameters
   \author Nicolas Toussaint
   
  This class implements a concrete representation of a pont in space. Besides
  its position - SetPosition() - the vtkLandmark contains a Polygonal representation
  of this point. You can choose the style of this representation by calling SetLandmarkType().

  This representation has some visualization properties that can be set. SetScale()
  will scale the polygonal representation. The position of its center corresponds to
  the vtkLandmark global position : SetPosition().
  
  The landmark has a selection flag, for the user conveniance, A call of Select() will make each actor
  switch between the two different properties provided by the user : SetProperty() and SetSelectedProperty().
  

  The landmark contains a list of actors that represent the landmark in the 3D space.
  Adding and removing actors can be done by AddActor() and RemoveActor().
  
  Some additional parameters can be held by the vtkLandmark, such as a name (with SetName()), but
  also any kind of scalar value. Simply call SetFlag(). Any previous value of the same key
  will be overridden by the new one. Access to the list of flag keys by GetFlagKeys().

  WARNING : Don't use this class alone. Please use the vtkLandmarkManager class instead.

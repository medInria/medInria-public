// Resources are generally compiled into the executable or library binaries

// for resources to be placed in separate files. This can be done through the
// add_external_resources macro of the cmake project. External resources are
// stored differently depending on the OS, so this file provides functions to
// retrieve the external resource paths in a platform-independant way.
// NOTE: External Qt binary resources (rcc files) must also be registered using
// QResource::registerResource(path_to_resource).

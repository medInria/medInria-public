 * \brief TO BE CAHNGED
 *        This file was written as a modification to the itkMetaImageIO
 *        as a new method for reading in files from the Inrimage 7.5 specification.
 *        An Inrimage 7.5 specification consists of 2 files.  The first file is has a .hdr extension
 *        that is the header information containing specific information about the
 *        image dimensions, and other information concerning the data.
 *        The second file has a .img file extenstion and it contains the raw image data.

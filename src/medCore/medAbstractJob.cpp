    * This run() method runs into a thread different from the main GUI thread,
    * but the thread() attribute on the medRunnableProcess is set to the main
    * GUI thread, meaning all signals sent to this medRunnableObject will trigger
    * slots to be run in the main GUI thread. Problem is, if we have the auto-delete
    * activated in the QThreadPool, this object will be deleted (not deleteLater'd)
    * and if it has pending events, it might trigger a slot on it after it was
    * deleted, and boom, crash.
    * So we disable the autoDelete and replace it with a deleteLater(), which
    * garantees us that the object will not have any pending events before
    * deletion.

/**
* @class medAbstractViewCollection
* @author Pierre Fillard
* @brief Extends medAbstractView to carry a collection of views instead of one (container class).
*
* This class is a simple extension of medAbtractView to make it able to carry more than
* one view at a time. It might be desirable when:
* - data contains more than one actual data (such as medAbstractDataCollection)
*
* The method views() must be reimplemented in subclass to return the list of views the object
* is carrying. Morevoer, the signals viewAdded() and viewRemoved() must be called when a
* new view is created / deleted.
*
* Note that this class works in cunjunction with a medViewPool. When passed to a pool, all views
* will automatically be added instead of the view itself. The pool listens to the signal viewAdded()
* and viewRemoved() to maintain its internal list of views up-to-date.

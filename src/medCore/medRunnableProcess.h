 * This class allows to run a dtkAbstractProcess in a separate thread.
 * Since it derives from medJobItem, this class benefits from the same
 * signals. It can also be used in cunjunction with the medJobManager.
 * As for any medJobItem, a non-blocking connection is needed for
 * QThreadPool::waitForDone()

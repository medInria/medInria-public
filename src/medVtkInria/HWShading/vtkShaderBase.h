/**
 * vtkShaderBase.h
 * by Tim Peeters
 *
 * 2005-05-03	Tim Peeters
 * - First version
 *
 * 2005-05-17	Tim Peeters
 * - Removed functionality dealing with GLhandles. This was moved to  a new
 *   vtkShaderBaseHandle subclass.
 *
 * 2005-06-06	Tim Peeters
 * - Switched to OpenGL 2.0
 *
 * 2005-07-04	Tim Peeters
 * - Instead of using glew, set GL_GLEXT_PROTOTYPES and then include gl.h
 *
 * 2005-07-14	Tim Peeters
 * - Use glew again. On Windows it seems to be needed.
 * - Add SupportsOpenGLVersion() function.
 *
 * 2006-01-30	Tim Peeters
 * - Removed #include <GL/glew.h>

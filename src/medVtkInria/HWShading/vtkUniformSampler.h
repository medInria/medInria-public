/**
 * Class for representing uniform sampler variables.
 * Samplers are used to pass the name/index of a texture to use to a shader.
 *
 * Same implementation as vtkUniformInt. Here, there is no distinction between
 * sampler1D, sampler2D, sampler3D, samplerCube, sampler1DShadow or
 * sampler2DShadow. Note that the corresponding texture must be of the
 * type matching the sampler type.
 *
 * This class may be modified in the future to also handle the loading of the
 * texture and/or check for restrictions imposed on samplers.
